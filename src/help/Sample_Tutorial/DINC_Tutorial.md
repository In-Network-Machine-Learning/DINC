# DINC Tutorial : Run Distributed DT on a Fat-Tree Data Canter
![Planter Logo](../../images/logo.png)
<aside>
ðŸ’¡ A guide to set up and run distributed DT<sub>EB</sub> (generated by Planter, an automating in-network machine learning framework) on a sample Fat-Tree data canter topology and tested by BMv2. Please do not use this setup to regenerate results in the paper, the detailed setup can be found in ./src/eval/evaluation.md.

## Requirements

1. BMv2 supported
2. Python 3.10 or above
3. All needed python packets installed

## Let's "Distributing" DT<sub>EB</sub> now

- Run Planter with ```-m``` (manually config) mode with program after ```-d```:

	```
	(changgang-python3.10) changgang@changgangsmbp2 DINC % python3 DINC.py -m -d ./src/sample/Planter_DT/DT_performance_Iris.p4
	```
- The distributing strategy is generated by DINC in this process:
