## Supported Architectures
The architectures here are indicative of the architecture used in your p4 file (e.g., ```#include <tna.p4>```). It is located under the ```./src/architectures/``` folder. Recommended architectures are marked with ðŸ”¥.


**1. TNA ðŸ”¥** [Folder](../../architecture/tna) - The Tofino Native Architecture (TNA) [Link](https://github.com/barefootnetworks/Open-Tofino/blob/master/PUBLIC_Tofino-Native-Arch-Document.pdf) is an architecture designed for Intel Tofino harware and emulation targets. One example is the Tofino Switch. 

**2. v1model ðŸ”¥** [Folder](../../architecture/v1model) - The v1model [Link](https://sdn.systemsapproach.org/switch.html) was originally designed to support P4<sub>14</sub> and later to support P4<sub>16</sub>. It is used in BMv2, P4Pi-enabled BMv2, and P4Pi-enabled T4P4S.
