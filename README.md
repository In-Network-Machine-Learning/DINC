## Introducing DINC
 DINC is a framework to provide automating distributed in-network computing service. 
 
## Setting up the DINC environment <span id = "environment"></span>

DINC requires python 3.10 or above, with the packages listed in [requirements\_Python3\_10\_8.txt](./src/configs/requirements_Python3_10_8.txt). To install the aforementioned packages, start your working environment and execute the following command:

```
pip3 install -r ./src/configs/requirements_Python3_10_8.txt
``` 

## Getting started with DINC

First, prepare a working environment as described in the previous section [Link](#environment). 

Run the following command to start DINC in manual configuration mode ```-m``` with target in-network computing program directory after ```-d```. Use help model with ```-h``` command to see additional options. 

```
python3 DINC.py -m -d <directory>
``` 

ðŸ’¡ A detailed getting started tutorial [Link: "Please click me!"](./src/help/Sample_Tutorial/DINC_Tutorial.md) (**Strongly Recommended**). 

## DINC Supports
DINC supports a wide range of modules mainly including modular Topologies, Architectures, and Usecases:

- DINC Supported Topologies [wiki](./src/help/DINC_Supports/DINC_Supported_Topologies.md) 
- DINC Supported Architectures [wiki](./src/help/DINC_Supports/DINC_Supported_Architectures.md) 
- DINC Supported Usecases [wiki](./src/help/DINC_Supports/DINC_Supported_Use_Cases.md) 

DINC also supports modular [Slicer](./src/slicing)s, [Solver](./src/solver)s, [Code Generator](./src/code_generator)s, [Test Controller](./src/test)s, etc.


## How to manually mark P4 grogram for DINC
The following figure gives a general outlook of how P4 programs are  sliced in the current P4 slicer module ([Manually](./src/slicing/Manually)). 
<!--There are also samples sliced programs under folder [Sample](./src/slicing/Sample)-->

## DINC's Availability

DINC is currently under a peer-review process. **_The source code will be made available once the peer-reviewed version is published_**.

If you're interested in this work and find anything unclear, please feel free to contact me at ```changgang.zheng@eng.ox.ac.uk```. **_We are welcoming collaborations._** It can be exciting to collaborate, if you think in-network machine learning is helpful to your research or use case. If there are any potential interests, please feel free to contact my supervisor ```noa.zilberman@eng.ox.ac.uk``` and me ```changgang.zheng@eng.ox.ac.uk```.
